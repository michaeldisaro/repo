# repo
WIP at early stage

This is a side project made to learn Rust and manage io-core-metarepo without the use of lerna bootstrap that is really slow.

The `repo` command allows to manage a metarepo selectively by passing `link`, `unlink` and `copy` command as arguments, a `project` as relative path from the root path and optionally also a `path` to use command from outside a repo.

Any advice and review is really appreciated. Maybe this is "bad code" since it is my first time with Rust.
